Overpowered automata is a turtle with an Overpowered Mechanic Soul upgrade. This upgrade has all of the abilities of the original automata.  

This automata will not use any item durability, however there is a very small chance that with every automata operation that the Mechanic Soul upgrade will just break- Forever. Once the upgrade has broken it can not be used again.

## How to craft

To create a husbandry soul, you need to feed 3 different types of animals via the [feedSoul](weak_automata.md#feedsoul) function to a weak automata core.
The core needs to be placed inside the turtle into the current active slot(Usually the first one).

The turtle needs 9 animals in total:

| Animal | Amount |
| ------ | ------ |
|   Cow  |    3   |
|  Sheep |    3   |
| Chicken |   3   |

Step by Step:

- Create a weak automata turtle(A normal turtle with a weak automata core as upgrade)
- Place another weak automata core in the current active slot of the turtle
- run `weakAutomata#feedSoul()` for every animal while the animal is in front of the turtle

Example 
```lua
core = peripheral.find("weak_automata")

successful, message = core.feedSoul()
print(successful)
print(message)
```

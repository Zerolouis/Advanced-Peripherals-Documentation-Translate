# Mod Integrations

## How do they work?

To use our third party integrations you can simply place your computer or a modem next to a supported block and wrap it.
If the block is supported, you can use the functions it'll provide, see the block's specific page for more information.

Example with a botania mana flower:
```lua linenums="1"
local flower = peripheral.find("manaFlower")

print("Stored mana: ".. flower.getMana())
print("Mana capacity: ".. flower.getMaxMana())
print("Is on enchanted soul?: ".. flower.isOnEnchantedSoil())
```
